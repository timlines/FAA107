# MINDS-i FAA PART 107 - VOICE OVER PROJECT

MINDS-i Education is developing a new curriculum for teaching high school students to prepare for the FAA Part 107 drone certification. 

We have two talented voice actors for the project, Rusty will cover the first two sections, Airspace and Heavier than Air. Kat will cover Weather and Crew.
