# 1.4 Heavier Than Air - Manuver

## Slide 37

```
Since the centrifugal force equals mass times the centrifugal acceleration and gravitational force on the aircraft equals the mass of the aircraft times the acceleration due to gravity, the vector sum of the centifugal force and the gravitational force which is the load force is the same as the vector sum of the centrifugal acceraltion and the gravitational acceration multiplied by the mass.

The vector sum of the centrifugal acceration and the gravitational accerlation is the apparent acceleration. 

Therefore, the force of load equals the mass of the aircraft times a apparent.

and a accerlation apparent equals the force of the load divided by the mass of the aircraft.

and the load factor is the force of the load divided by the mass of the aircraft times g, the gravitational acceleration.

Which could also be restated as the force of the laod divided by the aircraft's weight equals the load factor.
