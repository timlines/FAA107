# 1.3 Heavier Than Air - Intro

TODO: @Rusty Re-record audio for the below slides changing the typo "convers" to "covers".

## Slide 3

@Rusty Re-record audio for slide 3. Note: "2. The Wing & the Propeller as Airfoils"

```
The FAA exam focus on heavier than air flight and specifically on fixed wing aircraft. Fixed wing aircraft are airplanes with wings that do not move.

Such aircraft are commonly used by commercial airlines and general aviation. 

“Heavier Than Air Flight” will cover the basics of the flight of such aircraft in five sections:

Section 1. Fixed Wing Aircraft.
Section 2. The Wing & the Propeller as Airfoils
Section 3. Forces, Stability & Balance
Section 4. Maneuverability & Load
Section 5. Limitations due to Weight & Load

```

The Wing and the Propeller as Airfoils

During flight much of an aircraft’s response to its flight configuration depends on how its wing responds to the flow of air around it. This wing is in fact an airfoil and therefor the wing’s response is governed by the same basic principles as that of an airfoil. 

Section 2, “The Wing as an Airfoil”, covers: 

-The airfoil’s generation of lift through its shape.

-The forces on an airfoil.

-The dependance of these forces on the air density and flow around the airfoil.

-The dynamic relationship between lift and the Angle of Attack.

-The propeller as a twisted airfoil.

Forces, Stability & Balance

Good flight characteristics in an aircraft depend on a balance between the forces acting on the aircraft. In particular the force of lift and the force of gravity must be balanced in a stable fashion.  

Section 3, “Forces, Stability & Balance”, covers: 

-The force of lift and the locus about which it acts, the “Center of Pressure”  

-The force of gravity (weight) and the “Center of Gravity”, 

-Stability.  

-The relationship between the Center of Pressure and Center of Gravity that determines balance & how this affects stability.

Maneuverability & Load

The maneuverability of and aircraft allows it to change direction during flight. However maneuvers, such as turns, generate stress on the airframe referred to as load.

Section 4, “Maneuverability & Load”, covers: 

-The definitions of maneuverability and controllability.

-The mechanical means through which an aircraft is controlled in flight.

-One of the most important basic maneuvers, the coordinated turn.

-G load and the forces that cause it.

-The consequences of high G maneuvers.

Limitations due to Weight & Load

Certain constraints on the cargo capacity, cargo distribution and G-loads pulled must be obeyed for safe flight. These constraints become more strict if atmospheric conditions are unfavorable. 

Section 5, “Limitations due to Weight & Load”, covers: 

-Weight and what causes it.  

-The effects of increased aircraft weight.

-Proper weight distribution.

-G load and its potentially adverse affects.

-Atmospheric conditions that reduce carrying capacity and maneuverability.
