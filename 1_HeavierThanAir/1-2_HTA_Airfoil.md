The Wing and Propeller as Airfoils

The dynamics that govern the forces on  
the wing during flight are of particular  
importance in dictating the behavior of  
a fixed wing aircraft.  

Factors that affect the performance  
of propellers (essentially twisted airfoils)  
determine the ability of aircraft to  
generate thrust.

This section will discuss the  
wing and the propeller  
in the context of airfoils.
