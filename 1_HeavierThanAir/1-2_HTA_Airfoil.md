# 1.2 Heavier Than Air - Airfoil

## Slide 1

```
Heavier Than Air Flight. The wing and propellar as airfoils.

## Slide 2

**Script:**
```
The Wing and Propeller as Airfoils

The dynamics that govern the forces on  
the wing during flight are of particular  
importance in dictating the behavior of  
a fixed wing aircraft.  

Factors that affect the performance  
of propellers (essentially twisted airfoils)  
determine the ability of aircraft to  
generate thrust.

This section will discuss the  
wing and the propeller  
in the context of airfoils.

Summary

Aircraft are held up in the air by their wings. The wing itself is an airfoil. Therefore the dynamics that affect an airfoil in flight also determine the behavior of an aircraft’s wing in flight.

An airfoil is an elongated surface with a cross-section that has greater curvature on top than on the bottom. Due to this shape the airfoil generates lift when flown through the air as a low pressure region develops above it. This low pressure region “sucks” the airfoil upward.

The lift acts about a locus, a point on the airfoil referred to as the Center of Pressure (CP).
```

## Slide 39

**Script:**

```
There are two forces that act on an airfoil: lift and drag. Lift is perpendicular to the direction of the airflow and drag is parallel to it.

Lift and drag are dependent on the airfoil’s velocity through the air, the air density and the angle the airfoil makes with the air stream.  As the velocity through the air increases both lift and drag increase. Likewise as the density of the air increases both lift and drag increase.

The angle the airfoil makes with the air is the “angle of attack” or “AoA”. Lift and drag are dependent on this angle.
```
## Slide 40

**Script:**

```
Drag tends to increase as the AoA deviates from 0. The greater the AoA up to the critical angle, the greater the lift.

Lift can become negative if the angle of attack is negative. For such angles the wing can cause an aircraft to accelerate downward.

If the AoA is increased too much then turbulence develops behind the wing and the lift falls off sharply. This  is referred to as a stall.
```

## Slide 41

**Script:**
```
Propellers are essentially twisted airfoils. The propeller pulls an aircraft through the air by generating ‘lift’ in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the propellers spin.

Propeller thrust increase with:

Faster propeller spin speeds
Denser air
Higher propeller pitch
Lower aircraft airspeed
```

## Slide 42

**Script:**
```
The next section will discuss how forces such as the lift generated by the airfoil of the wing and weight and their balance affect the aircraft during flight.
