Physics of Weather

Local weather patterns are a product of global weather patterns. These weather patterns are created by an interplay between the atmosphere, the oceans, and the thermal exchange of the Earth with space. The driving generator behind weather on earth is the radiant energy from the Sun.

Physics of Weather covers global currents in the atmosphere and the oceans, how these global patterns affect weather over the United States; and the fundamental physics of gasses.

Surface Effects

This section discusses phenomena that are a result of the interaction of the atmosphere with the surface of the earth. 

Turbulence is generated by large and small scale disturbances in air flow over surface features.

Condensation, frost, haze, mist and fog are a result of changes in air temperature caused by thermal exchange between the atmosphere and the earth.

Temperature inversion is where the air next to the ground is cooler than the next layer up.
