**Script:**
```
There are several concepts from physics which will be used in this module. These include:
Volume, Temperature, Pressure, Density, Humidity, and Dew Point.
```

**Script:**
```
Volume is the space occupied by an object or in this context a collection of gas molecules.
```

**Script:**
```
Temperature is actually a measure of the change in the number of states available for a system (change in entropy) given a change in internal energy. The less the total number of states available increase with energy the higher the temperature and vise versa. However this will NOT be on the test. 

```

**Script:**
```
Temperature can be thought of as roughly corresponding to how much energy is in the gas. More energy corresponds to faster more energetic molecules and a hotter gas.
```

**Script:**
```
Pressure is a measure of the force per unit area that a volume of air exerts on its surroundings. If the air is contained, such as in a tire, this is the force per unit area that the air exerts on the walls of its container. In the atmosphere it is the pressure the air exerts on adjoining volumes of air. Atmospheric air pressure is due to the weight of the air above pressing down on the air below.
```

**Script:**
```
Density is a measure of how dense something is or the mass per unit volume. In the context of atmospheric air, air tends to be more dense when there are more air molecules compressed into a smaller space.
```

## Slide 10 ##

**Script:**
```
There is a relationship between volume (V), temperature (T), pressure (P) and density:
nRT = PV
‘n’ is the number of gas molecules and tends to be proportional to density. R is a constant.  This relationship is referred to as the “Ideal Gas Law”.
```

**Script:**
```
Humidity and Dew Point are both related to water vapor in the air.
