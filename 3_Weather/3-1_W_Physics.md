There are several concepts from physics which will be used in this module. These include:
Volume, Temperature, Pressure, Density, Humidity, and Dew Point.
```

**Script:**
```
Volume is the space occupied by an object or in this context a collection of gas molecules.
```

**Script:**
```
Temperature is actually a measure of the change in the number of states available for a system (change in entropy) given a change in internal energy. The less the total number of states available increase with energy the higher the temperature and vise versa. However this will NOT be on the test. 

```

## Slide 7 ##

**Script:**
```
Temperature can be thought of as roughly corresponding to how much energy is in the gas. More energy corresponds to faster more energetic molecules and a hotter gas.
```

**Script:**
```
Pressure is a measure of the force per unit area that a volume of air exerts on its surroundings. If the air is contained, such as in a tire, this is the force per unit area that the air exerts on the walls of its container. In the atmosphere it is the pressure the air exerts on adjoining volumes of air. Atmospheric air pressure is due to the weight of the air above pressing down on the air below.
```

## Slide 9  ##

**Script:**
```
Density is a measure of how dense something is or the mass per unit volume. In the context of atmospheric air, air tends to be more dense when there are more air molecules compressed into a smaller space.
```

## Slide 10 ##

TODO: @Kat re-record to match the new script.

**Script:**
```
There is a relationship between volume (V), temperature (T), pressure (P) and density:
nRT = PV
‘n’ is the number of gas molecules and tends to be proportional to density. R is a constant.  This relationship is referred to as the “Ideal Gas Law”.
```

## Slide 11  ##

**Script:**
```
Humidity and Dew Point are both related to water vapor in the air.
```

## Slide 12 ##

**Script:**
```
Air is composed predominately of Nitrogen and Oxygen molecules.
```

## Slide 13 ##

TODO: @Kat re-record to match the new script.

**Script:**
```
Air is composed predominately of Nitrogen and Oxygen molecules.
Humidity is a measure of how much water vapor there is in the air. The more water vapor there is in the air the more ‘Humid’ it is. 
```

## Slide 14 ##

**Script:**
```
Air is composed predominately of Nitrogen and Oxygen molecules.
Humidity is a measure of how much water vapor there is in the air. The more water vapor there is in the air the more ‘Humid’ it is. 
Water molecules are less massive than oxygen or nitrogen molecules. This makes humid less dense than dryer air.
```
## Slide 15 ##

**Script:**
```
The dew point is the temperature at which the water vapor condenses out of the air. 
```

## Slide 16 ##

TODO: @Kat re-record to match the new script.

**Script:**
```
The dew point is the temperature at which the water vapor condenses out of the air. 
Hot air can hold more water than cold air. As the temperature decreases to reach the dew point the moister will condense out of the air forming clouds, fog; or if the temperature continues to go down, precipitation.

1. The Atmosphere
Regions, Pressure, Density & Temperature
```

## Slide 18 ##

TODO: @Kat re-record to match the new script.

**Script:**
```
The Earth is surrounded by an atmosphere of 78 percent Nitrogen (N2), 21 percent Oxygen (O2), 0.9 percent Argon (Ar), and 0.1 percent other gases. A variable but significant component of the other gases is water vapor. Gravity holds this atmosphere to the planet and compresses it. Energy from solar radiation creates large and small scale currents in this fluid of air.
```

## Slide 19 ##

TODO: @Kat re-record to match the new script.

**Script:**
```
The atmosphere is divided into regions based on height. The figure at right shows these regions with the height significantly expanded for clarity. The primary region of interest is the lowest and densest, the “troposphere”. 
```

## Slide 20 ##

TODO: @Kat re-record to match the new script.

**Script:**
```
The gravitational force that holds the atmosphere to the planet also causes a gradient in pressure from high pressures at low altitudes to low pressures at high altitudes. This gradient in pressure is due to the air on the bottom holding up and thereby being compressed by the air at higher altitudes.
A typical unit of air pressure measurement is the millibar(mb). 1 mb is equivalent to 0.0145 psi (pounds per square inch) or 0.75 mmHg.
Typical pressure readings at sea level are from 950.0 to 1040.0 mb.
```

## Slide 21 ##

TODO: @Kat re-record to match the new script.

**Script:**
```
Since air is a compressible gas, the air at low altitudes is much more dense than the air at high altitudes.
```

## Slide 22 ##

TODO: @Kat re-record to match the new script.

**Script:**
```
Air density is measured in aviation by “Density altitude”. This term is inspired by the gradient in air density with respect to altitude.
When atmospheric conditions, such as high pressure systems, cause the air to be denser the “density altitude” is said to be lower.
When atmospheric conditions, such as low pressure systems, cause the air to be less dense, the “density altitude” is said to be higher. 
```

## Slide 23 ##

TODO: @Kat re-record to match the new script.

**Script:**
```
Not only is there a pressure gradient from low to high altitudes, there is also a temperature gradient. 
The Earth tends to absorb solar energy which it passes to the air near its surface.
The heated air tends to rise, as it rises it decreases in pressure, increases in volume and cools.

```

## Slide 25 ##

TODO: @Kat re-record to match the new script.

**Script:**
```
Once the air cools, it descends again, increasing in pressure and temperature while decreasing in volume. Winds arise as a result of the convective process.
```
## Slide 26 ##

TODO: @Kat re-record to match the new script.

**Script:**
```
Due to the tendency of warm air to expand and cool as it rises, the troposphere (the lowest 10 km) of the atmosphere tends to decrease in temperature with height.
```

## Slide 27 ##

TODO: @Kat re-record to match the new script.

**Script:**
```
Over the course of the year the earth experiences variations in temperature. These temperature variations are caused by the tilt of the Earth’s rotational axis. The solar radiation in the northern and southern hemispheres varies significantly with the seasons.
In the north, the atmosphere is colder during the winter and warmer during the summer. In the southern hemisphere the seasons run opposite.

Planetary-scale Atmospheric Cells & the Jetstreams
```

## Slide 31 ##

TODO: @Kat re-record to match the new script.

**Script:**
```
On a planetary scale the equator tends to be heated more than the poles. This leads to flows in both the oceans and the atmosphere. In the Earth’s atmosphere it creates three cells in each hemisphere that extend around the planet.
```

## Slide 32 ##

TODO: @Kat re-record to match the new script.

**Script:**
```
On a planetary scale the equator tends to be heated more than the poles. This leads to flows in both the oceans and the atmosphere. In the Earth’s atmosphere it creates three cells in each hemisphere that extend around the planet.
These cells are named the “Hadley cell”, the “Ferrel cell” and the “Polar cell”, as shown at right.
These cells extend through the height of the lower region of the atmosphere, the troposphere making these cells from 10 to 15 km tall. The cell height in the figure is significantly exaggerated to show internal structure. 
```

## Slide 33 ##

TODO: @Kat re-record to match the new script.

**Script:**
```
In each hemisphere, the cell nearest the equator is the “Hadley cell”. 
As the air at the equator is heated, it starts to rise straight up. This draws in cooler air from the north (or south) along the ground. 
This creates a draw that causes the upper atmosphere to flow northward (or southward).
When the air reaches the edge of the cell it gets pulled under.
The low altitude part of the cell cycles south for the upper cell and north for the lower cell.
```

## Slide 34 ##

TODO: @Kat re-record to match the new script.

**Script:**
```
As the air in the Hadley cell flows, relative to the Earth’s surface, it picks up an apparent flow from east to west.  This east-west flow is due to the Earth rotating under the atmosphere. The Hadley cell retains this east to west flow even at high altitudes.
```

## Slide 35 ##

TODO: @Kat re-record to match the new script.

**Script:**
```
The Polar cell is similar to the Hadley cell with essentially the same flow direction.
```

## Slide 36 ##

TODO: @Kat re-record to match the new script.

**Script:**
```
The Ferrel cell, however differs from the other two cells.
The Ferrel cell is a kind of “whirlpool” between the Hadley and the Polar cells.
The flow direction of the Ferrel cell is the reverse of the flow direction in the Hadley and Polar cells. In the upper cell, the winds flow from north to south at high altitudes and from south to north at low altitudes.
```

## Slide 37 ##

TODO: @Kat re-record to match the new script.

**Script:**
```
The longitudinal flow in the Ferrel cell is dominated by conservation of angular momentum and an exchange of air from the Hadley cell.
At the surface, the air flow of the Ferrel cell has a west to east trend.
```

```
The low altitude winds are of particular importance in driving weather patterns across continents. 
The prevailing winds (at low altitudes) are shown in the figure at right.
The Ferrel cell is of particular importance in creating weather patterns over the continental United States.
```

## Slide 39 ##

TODO: @Kat re-record to match the new script.

**Script:**
```
The Ferrel cell is also associated with extremely strong bands of wind at high altitudes. The winds in these bands are referred to as the “Jetstream”.
```

## Slide 40 ##

TODO: @Kat re-record to match the new script.

**Script:**
```
These Jetstreams exist at the high altitude boundaries between the Ferrel cell and the two other cells. For each Ferral cell there are two jets. 
The polar jet occurs at the boundary between the Ferrel cell and the Polar Cell.
The subtropical jet is at the boundary between the Ferrel cell and the Hadley cell.
These winds are created by the interplay between the Earth’s rotation and the currents in the cells.
```

## Slide 41 ##

TODO: @Kat re-record to match the new script.

**Script:**
```
The jetstreams all flow from west to east and can reach speeds over 275 mph. Typically the jets exist at an altitude of over 30,000 ft however they can climb to over 50,000ft.
The figure at right shows a cross-section of a Jetstream.

Jetstreams move and change shape, breaking and rejoining and varying in intensity.

Planetary Ocean Currents
```

## Slide 46 ##

TODO: @Kat re-record to match the new script.

**Script:**
```
Weather patterns are created as moving air transfers heat and moisture through the atmosphere across continents and oceans.
Ocean currents as well as atmospheric currents play a significant role in generating weather conditions.
Global ocean currents are shown in the figure at left. Warm surface currents are shown in light cyan, while deep water currents are shown in purple. As with atmospheric flows, the primary driver for these currents is the disproportionate solar heating at the equator.

The surface currents that transfer water around the American coast are shown in the figure at left. Warm water is indicated by orange and cold by blue.
These currents play an important role in atmospheric temperature. As weather systems come off the ocean, the air temperature is strongly affected by the ocean temperature.

Most of the US is under the northern Ferrel cell and the prevailing surface winds are from west to east.
Therefore, the weather along the west coast largely comes off the ocean.

**Script:**
```
The southeast coast of the US is far enough to the south that it is affected by the junction between the Ferrel and the Hadley cell. At this latitude winds tend to blow to the west, sometimes swinging to the north.
Weather and storms come into the southeastern seaboard off the tropical ocean.

## Slide 54  ##

**Script:**
```
Weather that comes off the ocean tends to generate higher levels of precipitation due to the higher water vapor content. It also tends to be more constant in temperature throughout the year since oceans due to their circulation tend to resist the temperature variation more than landmasses.
```

**Script:**
```
Overall the weather of the continental US is determined by the prevailing winds.
the western coast of the continental US tends to be warmer than the north-eastern coast due to the influence of eastward winds and a relatively warm ocean.
The mid-section of the US tends to be dryer with greater extremes in temperature due to weather coming more off the continent and releasing its moisture over the western mountains. 
The south-eastern coast tends to be warm and damp due to warm northwestern wind coming of the tropical ocean.

There are several basic concepts from the physics of gasses that should be understood:
Volume is the space occupied by the gas, or a section of the gas.
Temperature can be thought of as roughly a measure of the energy in the gas, with faster moving gas molecules corresponding to higher temperature.

Pressure is a measure of the force per unit area that a volume of a gas exerts on its surroundings.
Density is a measure of how dense the gas is; or the mass of gas molecules per unit volume of gas.  The more molecules of gas there are and the heavier these molecules are the more dense the gas is.
There is a relationship between volume(V), temperature(T), pressure(P) and density (proportional to n): nRT=PV
Humidity is a measure of how much water vapor there is in the air; the more water vapor there is, the more ‘Humid’ it is.
Dew point is the temperature at which the water vapor condenses out of the air, forming mist, fog, condensation, or precipitation.
```

## Slide 59 ##

TODO: @Kat re-record to match the new script.

**Script:**
```
The Earth’s atmosphere is composed of nitrogen, oxygen and argon with a variable but significant component of water vapor. 
Energy from the sun warms the atmosphere and creates currents.  This energy changes in distribution from the winter to the summer due to the tilt of the Earth’s rotational axes, thus creating the seasons.
The atmosphere is divided into regions according to altitude, the lowest region, up to 33,000 ft or so, is the Troposphere.
Within the Troposphere the atmosphere tends to decrease in pressure, density, and temperature with altitude.  These trends and surface heating lead to convective cycling of air.
```

## Slide 60 ##

TODO: @Kat re-record to match the new script.

**Script:**
```
The pressure of the atmosphere increases as the surface is approached. Typical pressure readings at sea level are from 950.0 to 1040 millibar (mb).

Since air is compressible as a gas the density of air increases at lower altitudes.
The quantity “Density Altitude” describes air density in terms of altitude. Atmospheric conditions that tend to make air less dense such as heat or low pressure are said to raise the density altitude;  since these conditions make a lower altitude equivalent in terms of air density to a higher altitude.  Atmospheric conditions that tend to make air more dense such as low temperatures or high pressures are said to lower the density altitude; since these conditions make a higher altitude equivalent in terms of air density to a lower altitude.
```

## Slide 61 ##

TODO: @Kat re-record to match the new script.

**Script:**
```
Within the troposphere (below 33,000 ft) temperature decreases with altitude. 

When the sun warms the surface of the earth, energy is also transferred to air near the surface. This air warms. When atmospheric air warms, it rises and when it rises, it expands and when it expands, it cools. After the air cools it sinks again. This process is referred to as convection.
```

## Slide 62 ##

TODO: @Kat re-record to match the new script.

**Script:**
```
The sun creates currents in the atmosphere which lead to the circulation in three atmospheric cells and the jetstreams.
There are three circulation cells in each hemisphere: the Hadley cell, the Ferrel cell, and the Polar cell. In the upper hemisphere, the Hadley and Polar cells flow south at low altitude; while the Ferrel cell rotates opposite, and flows north at low altitude. 
An interaction between the flow in the cells and the rotation of the Earth causes the low-altitude winds in both the Hadley and Polar cells to come from the east. However the winds under the Ferrel cell tend to come from the west.
The Jetstreams are bands of extremely strong wind that tend to occur near the boundaries of the Ferrel cell.  The Jetstreams typically occur at altitudes above 30,000ft and may have winds reaching over 275 mph. The Jetstream plays a significant role in moving weather patterns across the North American continent. 
```

## Slide 63 ##

TODO: @Kat re-record to match the new script.

**Script:**
```
The heat from the sun not only drives global currents of air, it also creates currents in the Earth’s oceans. 
Global ocean currents sometimes referred to at the “Global Conveyor Belt” facilitate the exchange of heat between the equator and polar regions. 
Global ocean current play a significant role in weather patterns across the planet. Air temperature is strongly affected by ocean temperature as weather systems come off the ocean.
```

## Slide 64 ##

TODO: @Kat re-record to match the new script.

**Script:**
```
Global flows, dominate the large-scale weather trends across the continental United States.
Most of the Unites States is under the Ferrel cell which means that the prevailing winds are from southwest or west to northeast or east.
Weather in the west comes off the relatively warm ocean. Weather in the Midwest comes from over the landmass and is relatively dry and often more extreme in temperature. 
Weather in the southeast is affected by the Hadley cell, where winds from the southeast blow storm systems up off the tropical ocean. 
Southern and eastern Alaska is affected by the Ferrel cell which brings weather off the ocean. Northern Alaska receives cold winds from the Polar cells which bring weather from the northeast.
