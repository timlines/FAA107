## FAA PART 107 Style Guide
Where possible the following style guide standards should be applied.

Punctuation, such as commas (,) periods (.) and others would indicate a pause while recording. 


Use the MLA style guide
	-modify all points to use the mla style guide. Note acronyms/abbreviations.


All text should be read as a sentence instead of a list. 

Example: 
“Prohibited or Banned Airspace: Prohibited airspace and flight restricted zones”

Should be read as:
“Prohibited or banned airspace includes prohibited airspace and flight restricted zones”

Acronyms or abbreviations, the full phrase should be written out when first mentioned in a powerpoint. If the same acronym is mentioned a second time then can it be abbreviated. See the glossary for a complete list of acronyms.

Example: Drone flight is prohibited in Flight Restricted Zones (FRZ). The next time I mention FRZ’s I can use the abbreviation. (Read as Flight restricted Zones.)

Some Acronyms are also words like notam. It’s an acronym standing for Notice To Airman but it’s also pronounced as the word notam. no·​tam | \ ˈnōˌtam \. See the Glossary for a complete list of acronyms. 

Acronyms when plural are pronounced plural instead of read with the letter S.

Example. FRZ standing for Flight restricted zones would be written FRZs in the script but would not be pronounced F-R-Z-S, but instead F-R-Z’s. 

& should be replaced with the word “and”

Single letters except for “I” and “A” are simply written as a single letter, for example B.
